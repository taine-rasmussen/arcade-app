# arcade-app

**Currently under development!**

This project is a MERN stack web application based on a favourite online game hosting site I spent countless hours on as a kid - Miniclip! With the addition of user and game stats, a shop/economy system, and a rank/progression system. The app allows users to play various games, while tracking their progress and comparing it with others through leaderboards and awards. The shop/economy system allows users to spend in-game currency on upgrades and items, while the stats system records data such as high scores and win-loss ratios.
